## 🎯 Mission  
The mission of this project is to **explore the IIOT data from EnergyCo’s wind turbines** and identify areas where operations can be optimized. The analysis will focus on **performance efficiency, predictive maintenance**, and **cost reduction opportunities**. The objective is to build a data science framework that delivers actionable insights to improve turbine uptime and productivity.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started  
This section will guide you on how to set up the project, run it locally in **VS Code**, and ensure that the **Conda environment** is correctly configured. Follow these instructions to get started quickly.  

- **Prerequisites**:  
    - Install **Git**, **Conda**, and **Python 3.8.x or later**.
    - Ensure that **VS Code** is installed with the **Python** and **Jupyter** extensions enabled.  

---

## 🛠️ Project Setup Instructions  

### 1. **Clone the Repository**  
Open the **terminal** in VS Code and enter:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/busi732/Team-2-2024Fall.git  
cd Team-2-2024Fall  
```  

💡 **Tip**: Use VS Code’s integrated terminal (`Ctrl + \``) to simplify the process.

---

### 2. **Create the Conda Environment**  
The environment is defined in the `environment.yml` file. Run the following command:  
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml  
```  

---

### 3. **Activate the Environment**  
After creating the environment, activate it:  
```bash
conda activate turbine  
```  

💡 **VS Code Tip**: Set VS Code to use the active Conda environment. Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` (or `Cmd + Shift + P` on macOS), type **Python: Select Interpreter**, and select the **turbine** environment.

---

## 🌍 Environment Usage  

1. **Installing Packages**  
Install packages using either **conda** or **pip** under the activated environment:  
```bash
conda install <package_name>  
pip install <package_name>  
```  

2. **Example**:  
To install **Jupyter Notebook** and common data science libraries, run:  
```bash
pip install notebook ipython numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn  
```  

3. **Updating All Packages**:  
Keep the environment up-to-date:  
```bash
conda update --all  
```  

---

## 🔄 Updating the Environment  

If new packages are added during development, follow these steps to ensure all team members can stay in sync.  

### Method 1: Create a New Environment File  
```bash
conda env export > new_environment_filename.yml  
```  

### Method 2: Update the Existing `environment.yml` File  
```bash
conda env update --file environment.yml --prune  
```  
- **Note**: The `--prune` flag ensures any removed packages are also deleted locally.  

---

## 🔗 Contributing to the Project  

1. **After Making Changes**:  
Use the following commands to update your work on **GitHub**:  
```bash
git add .  
git commit -m "Add new files and update the environment"  
git push origin main  
```  

2. **Collaborative Workflow**:  
- When a team member pulls the latest changes, including an updated `environment.yml` file, they must update their environment:  
    ```bash
    conda env update --file environment.yml --prune  
    ```  

3. **Updating the Environment File**:  
After installing any new packages:
```bash
conda env export --no-builds > environment.yml  
```  
This keeps the `environment.yml` clean and avoids unnecessary dependencies.

---

## ❓ Getting Help  

If you encounter any issues:  
- **Open an issue** in the repository’s issue tracker.  
- **Check the `notebooks/mytests/` folder** for troubleshooting tips and test notebooks.  
- Reach out to teammates on the project’s communication channel (e.g., Slack or email).
